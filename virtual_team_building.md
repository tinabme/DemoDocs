# Virtual Team Activities

Remote work is becoming a common practice now. And why not, it's great, allowing for flexibility, diverse qualifications and thoughts, as well as a more efficient use of time. 

However, along with all of the benefits of remote work, there a downside that we can't overlook. Lack of social interactions and team bonding can leave team members feeling undervalued.

A study in the [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2013/07/we-all-need-friends-at-work) states, “close work friendships boost employee satisfaction by 50%.” and that, “people with a best friend at work are seven times more likely to engage fully in their work.”

All this information leads to the fact that team building is an essential part of remote work.

Make inclusion part of the day to day routine.
* Have team members join a shared team chat channel/room, for quick real-time conversations.
* Make video conferencing part of every meeting, for face to face conversations, content sharing, code reviews, and meeting chit chat. *I've even heard from some folks that that turn on the video conferencing leave it on all day for a virtual office feel.*
